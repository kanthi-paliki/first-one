#My First Project
This is my first project uploaded in GitHub.

##DESCRIPTION
A brief description about this project this is a mathematical problem where we feel like it consumes a lot of time when we are working on a paper to solve this one particular problem this is where i came up with this code where it simplifies our work load on paper and actually provides a accurate and price answers

##How to Run This:
All of us are aware of this newton forward interpolation method where we widely used in Scientific and engineering problems where function values need to be estimated at points between tabulated data 
Input --> The values of X and the values of Y.
Output --> Estimated or Interpolated value.
